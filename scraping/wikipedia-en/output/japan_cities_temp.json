Situated on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea, it is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy for the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The city straddles the Green Line between Israel and the West Bank; both Israelis and Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital. Israel controls the entire city and maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while the Palestinian National Authority and Palestine Liberation Organization ultimately foresee it as the seat of power for the State of Palestine. Due to this long-running dispute, neither claim is widely recognized internationally. A site of permanent inhabitation since at least the 3rd millennium BCE, significant construction activities began throughout the city in the 9th century BCE, and by the 8th century BCE, Jerusalem had developed into the capital of the Iron Age Kingdom of Judah. During its history, the city has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The city was first destroyed by the Babylonians in 587–586 BCE, rebuilt during the Persian period, and became a royal capital again under Hasmonean and Herodian rule. In 63 BCE, it was captured by Rome, and in 70 CE, following a Jewish revolt, destroyed again. Ownership of the city then passed into Muslim hands with the conquest of the Levant in 638 CE. In 1538 CE, the surrounding city walls were rebuilt for a last time under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today, these walls define the Old City, which has historically been split into four areas known since the 19th century as the Jewish Quarter, the Armenian Quarter, the Christian Quarter, and the Muslim Quarter (clockwise from the southeast end). The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and has been on the List of World Heritage in Danger since 1982. Since 1860, Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2015, Jerusalem had a population of some 850,000 residents, comprising approximately 200,000 secular Jewish Israelis, 350,000 Haredi Jews, and 300,000 Palestinian Arabs. In 2016, the city's population was 882,700, of which Jews comprised 536,600 (61%), Muslims comprised 319,800 (36%), Christians comprised 15,800 (2%), and unclassified subjects comprised 10,300 (1%). According to the Hebrew Bible, the city was conquered from the Jebusites by the Israelite king David, who established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel. David's son and successor, Solomon, later commissioned the building of the First Temple in the city. Modern scholars argue that Jews branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous — and later monotheistic — religion centered on El/Yahweh. These foundational events, straddling the dawn of the 1st millennium BCE, assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of \"holy city\" (עיר הקודש, 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible that was adopted by Christians as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament's account of Jesus' crucifixion and subsequent resurrection there. In Sunni Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city after Mecca and Medina in present-day Saudi Arabia. This is due to its status as the first qibla (the standard direction for Muslim prayers) before Mecca. In Islamic tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad made his Night Journey to Jerusalem in 621 CE, from where he ascended to heaven and spoke to God, according to the Quran. As a result of all of these events, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance; namely the Temple Mount (also known as Al-Aqsa or Haram al-Sharif) with the Dome of the Rock, Al-Aqsa Mosque and Western Wall, as well as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Today, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and its peace process. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas captured and later annexed by Israel while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was captured and later annexed by Jordan. However, during the 1967 Six-Day War, East Jerusalem was captured from Jordan by Israel, after which it was effectively annexed and incorporated into the other Israeli-held parts of the city, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the Jerusalem Law of 1980, refers to \"complete and undivided\" Jerusalem as the country's capital. All of the institutions of the Israeli government are located within Jerusalem, including the Knesset, the residences of the Prime Minister (Beit Aghion) and President (Beit HaNassi), and the Supreme Court. While Israel's claim to sovereignty over West Jerusalem is more widely accepted by the international community, its claim to sovereignty over East Jerusalem is regarded as illegitimate, and East Jerusalem is consequently recognized by the United Nations as Palestinian territory that is occupied by Israel.", "ja": "エルサレムまたはイェルサレム（ヘブライ語: יְרוּשָׁלַיִם‎ ; アラビア語: القُدس‎ ）は、イスラエルにある都市。エルサレムは世界最古の都市の一つであり、エルサレムはユダヤ教、キリスト教、イスラム教の聖市と見なされている。 イスラエルはエルサレムが自国の「首都」であると宣言しているものの、国際連合など国際社会はこれを認めておらず、イスラエルの首都はテルアビブであるとみなしており、パレスチナ自治政府は東エルサレムをパレスチナ国の首都と主張している。イスラエルと国交を持つ諸国も、大使館や領事館はエルサレムでなくテルアビブに置いてきたが、2017年にアメリカ合衆国のドナルド・トランプ大統領はエルサレムをイスラエルの首都であると明言し、2018年5月にアメリカ大使館をテルアビブからエルサレムに移転させた。"}}]}, {"city": {"nameEn": "Beppu", "nameJa": "", "position": {"latitude": 33.27952777777778, "longtitude": 131.50002777777777}, "country": "Japan", "area": 125.13, "wikiUrl": {"en": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppu"}, "population": 122643, "abstract": {"en": "Beppu (別府市, Beppu-shi) is a city in Ōita Prefecture on the island of Kyushu, Japan.

The city became a World Heritage Site in 1987, and was later added to the transnational World Heritage Site known as the \"Great Spa Towns of Europe\" in 2021. Bath is also the largest city and settlement in Somerset. The city became a spa with the Latin name Aquae Sulis (\"the waters of Sulis\") c. 60 AD when the Romans built baths and a temple in the valley of the River Avon, although hot springs were known even before then. Bath Abbey was founded in the 7th century and became a religious centre; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, claims were made for the curative properties of water from the springs, and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era. Georgian architecture, crafted from Bath stone, includes the Royal Crescent, Circus, Pump Room and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761. Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood, the Elder, and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew. Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century. Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II. Bath became part of the county of Avon in 1974, and, following Avon's abolition in 1996, has been the principal centre of Bath and North East Somerset. Bath has up to 1.3 million yearly visitors, making it one of ten English cities visited most by overseas tourists.

It is the largest city in the United States by total area whose government is not consolidated with a county, parish, or borough. Though primarily in Harris County, small portions of the city extend into Fort Bend and Montgomery counties, bordering other principal communities of Greater Houston such as Sugar Land and The Woodlands. The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30, 1836, at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou (a point now known as Allen's Landing) and incorporated as a city on June 5, 1837. The city is named after former General Sam Houston, who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas's independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles (40 km) east of Allen's Landing. After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s, Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century. The arrival of the 20th century brought a convergence of economic factors that fueled rapid growth in Houston, including a burgeoning port and railroad industry, the decline of Galveston as Texas's primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane, the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel, and the Texas oil boom. In the mid-20th century, Houston's economy diversified, as it became home to the Texas Medical Center—the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and NASA's Johnson Space Center, home to the Mission Control Center. Since the late 19th century Houston's economy has had a broad industrial base, in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment, Houston has the second-most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits (after New York City). The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled. Nicknamed the \"Bayou City\", \"Space City\", \"H-Town\", and \"the 713\", Houston has become a global city, with strengths in culture, medicine, and research. The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds and a large and growing international community. Houston is the most diverse metropolitan area in Texas and has been described as the most racially and ethnically diverse major city in the U.S. It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, which attract more than seven million visitors a year to the Museum District. The Museum District is home to nineteen museums, galleries, and community spaces. Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene in the Theater District, and offers year-round resident companies in all major performing arts.", "ja": "ヒューストン（英語：Houston、[ˈhjuːstən, ˈjuːstən]）は、アメリカ合衆国のテキサス州の都市。同州最大かつ北アメリカ有数の世界都市。全米4位となる2,304,580人（2020年国勢調査）の人口を抱える。ハリス郡を中心に9郡にまたがるヒューストン都市圏の人口は7,122,240人（2020年国勢調査）にのぼる。市域面積は1,500km2に及び、市郡一体の自治体を除くとオクラホマシティに次ぐ全米第2の広さである。 市は1836年8月30日にオーガストゥス・チャップマンとジョン・カービーのアレン兄弟によって、バッファロー・バイユーの河岸に創設された。市名は当時のテキサス共和国大統領で、サンジャシントの戦いで指揮を執った将軍のサミュエル・ヒューストンから名を取って付けられた。翌1837年6月5日にヒューストンは正式に市制が施行された。19世紀後半には海港や鉄道交通の中心として、また綿花の集散地として栄えた。やがて1901年に油田が見つかると、市は石油精製・石油化学産業の中心地として成長を遂げた。20世紀中盤に入ると、ヒューストンには世界最大の医療研究機関の集積地テキサス医療センターやアメリカ航空宇宙局（NASA）のジョンソン宇宙センターが設置され、先端医療の研究や航空宇宙産業の発展が進んだ。古くからこうした様々な産業を持ち、フォーチュン500に入る企業の本社数がニューヨークに次いで多いヒューストンは、テキサス州のみならず成長著しいサンベルトの中心都市の1つであり、アメリカ合衆国南部のメキシコ湾岸地域における経済・産業の中枢である。また、全米最大級の貿易港であるヒューストン港 を前面に抱え、ユナイテッド航空（旧・コンチネンタル航空）のハブ空港であるジョージ・ブッシュ・インターコンチネンタル空港を空の玄関口とする、交通の要衝でもある。また、日本を含む世界86ヶ国が領事館を置く。 このようにヒューストンは工業都市・ビジネス都市としてのイメージが強い都市であるが、文化水準の高い都市でもある。ダウンタウンの南側には10以上の博物館・美術館が建ち並び、年間700万人の訪問者を呼び寄せるミュージアム・ディストリクトがある。ミュージアム・ディストリクトに隣接するエリアには、全米の総合大学の中で常にトップ25位以内の高評価を受けている名門私立大学、ライス大学のキャンパスが広がっている。一方、ダウンタウンの中心部に位置するシアター・ディストリクトはヒューストンにおける演技芸術の中心地で、演劇のみならず、オペラ・オーケストラ・バレエなど多彩な演技芸術の公演が行われている。 ジョンソン宇宙センターの存在から、ヒューストンには1967年にスペース・シティ（宇宙の街）という公式な別名が付けられた。地元住民はこの他にバイユー・シティ（バイユーの街）、マグノリア・シティ（マグノリアの街）、H・タウンなどと呼ぶこともある。"}}, {"nameEn": "North Vancouver", "nameJa": "", "position": {"latitude": 49.31666666666667, "longtitude": -123.06666666666666}, "country": "Canada", "area": null, "wikiUrl": {"en": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vancouver_(city)", "ja": "http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ノースバンクーバー_(ブリティッシュコロンビア州)"}, "population": 58120, "abstract": {"en": "The City of North Vancouver is a city on the north shore of Burrard Inlet, British Columbia, Canada.

(read in Filipino as Kyusi), is the most populous city in the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 2,960,048 people. It was founded on October 12, 1939, and was named for Manuel L. Quezon, the second president of the Philippines. The city was intended to be the national capital of the Philippines that would replace Manila, as the latter was suffering from overcrowding, lack of housing, poor sanitation, and traffic congestion. To create Quezon City, several barrios were carved out from the towns of Caloocan, Marikina, San Juan and Pasig, in addition to the eight vast estates the Philippine government purchased for this purpose. It was officially proclaimed as the national capital on October 12, 1949, and several government departments and institutions moved out of Manila and settled into the new capital city. This necessitated the expansion of the city northwards, carving out Novaliches from Caloocan which divided it into two non-contiguous parts. Several barrios were also taken from San Mateo and parts of Montalban. However, on June 24, 1976, Presidential Decree 940 was enacted, which reverted national capital status to Manila while the whole of Metro Manila was designated as the seat of government. Quezon City is known for its culture, entertainment industry and media, and is aptly called the \"City of Stars\". Major broadcasting networks have their headquarters and studios in the city. It is also known for its commerce, education, research, technology, politics, tourism, art and sports. Several national government branches including the Batasang Pambansa Complex, the seat of House of Representatives of the Philippines, calls the city home. Quezon City is a planned city. It covers a total area of 161.11 square kilometers (62.20 sq mi), making it the largest city in Metro Manila in terms of land area. It is politically subdivided into Six Congressional Districts, which represents the city in the Lower House of the Congress of the Philippines. The city has 142 barangays under the City Government. National government departments and agencies are mostly situated at the National Government Center I (NGC I) in Diliman, and the National Government Center II (NGC II) in Batasan Hills, where the Lower House of the Philippine Congress is located.

It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population of 13,866,009 inhabitants during the 2020 Chinese census. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 11,165,706 inhabitants and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper. It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council. Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in Northern China and part of the Jing-Jin-Ji megapolis. In terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time, numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and 1976 Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf.
